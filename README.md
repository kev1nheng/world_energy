## About Dataset
Data on Energy by Our World in Data

This dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics.

Data sources

    Energy consumption (primary energy, energy mix and energy intensity): this data is sourced from a combination of two sources‚Äîthe BP Statistical Review of World Energy and SHIFT Data Portal.
    Electricity consumption (electricity consumption, and electricity mix): this data is sourced from a combination of two sources‚Äîthe BP Statistical Review of World Energy and EMBER ‚Äì Global Electricity Dashboard.
    Other variables: this data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Gapminder, Maddison Project Database, etc.). More information is available in our codebook.

The complete Our World in Data Energy dataset

Our complete Energy dataset is available in CSV, XLSX, and JSON formats.

The CSV and XLSX files follow a format of 1 row per location and year. The JSON version is split by country, with an array of yearly records.

The variables represent all of our main data related to energy consumption, energy mix, electricity mix as well as other variables of potential interest.
Changelog

    On March 31, 2021, we updated 2020 electricity mix data.
    On September 9, 2020, the first version of this dataset was made available.

Data alterations

    standardize names of countries and regions. Since the names of countries and regions are different in different data sources, standardize all names to the Our World in Data standard entity names.
    recalculate primary energy in terawatt-hours. The primary data sources on energy‚Äîthe BP Statistical Review of World Energy, for example‚Äîtypically report consumption in terms of exajoules. recalculated these figures as terawatt-hours using a conversion factor of 277.8.
    calculate per capita figures. All of our per capita figures are calculated from our metric Population, which is included in the complete dataset. These population figures are sourced from Gapminder and the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPP).
